      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>As the HackerYou Web Accessibility Club is dedicated to inclusiveness online, all participants in our meet-ups (presenters and attendees alike) must respect that inclusiveness in person as well. This means that everyone should enjoy a safe and welcoming space at our meet-ups, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We require our presenters to be mindful of this code when choosing the language and/or imagery used in their presentations. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

      <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>Verbal comments and/or images that reinforce social structures of domination;</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;</li>
          <li>Sustained disruptive behaviour;</li>
          <li>Inappropriate physical contact;</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention;</li>
          <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Enforcement:</h2>

      <p>Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      <p>Meet-up organizers retain the right to take any actions necessary to prevent participants who do not abide by this code from creating a hostile environment.</p>

      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>If any participant or speaker who is part of the HackerYou Accessibility Club community makes you feel unsafe or unwelcome (either online, or in-person), please report it as soon as possible by one of the following methods:</p>

      <h3>Making a Personal Report<h3>

      <p>Meet-up organizers Jen Taylor and Maureen Holland will always be available to listen to your report in person at events. When making an in-person report, please rest assured that you will be able to make the report in a space where you cannot be overheard and you can bring someone to support you if needed. You will not be asked to confront anyone and your identity will not be shared.</p>

      <p>You can also contact Maureen and Jen by email:</p>
      <p>maureen[at]maureenlholland.com</p>
      <p>jen[at]jentaylorcodes.com</p>

      <h3>Making an Anonymous Report:</h3>

      <p>You do not have to enter an email address or your name to make a report through this form:</p>

      (FORM WITH JUST TEXTBOX? Apparently Wufoo offers anonymous forms as well)

      <p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">sample policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>
